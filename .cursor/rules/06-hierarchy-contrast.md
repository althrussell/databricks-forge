# Hierarchy & Contrast Rules (Pixelmingo learnings)

- Implement the 5-layer model:
  L0 page bg, L1 sections, L2 interactives, L3 selection, L4 primary CTA.
- Never allow “same-volume UI”:
  adjacent cards/sections must differ in tone or border/shadow.
- Differentiate:
  - filter chips vs status badges
  - row hover vs row selected
- Primary CTA must be visually dominant and unique per page.
- Add explicit states for:
  hover, active, disabled, focus-visible for all interactives.
- If the page looks “flat”, introduce:
  subtle gradient on L0 and/or L1, stronger border, and a soft shadow.
