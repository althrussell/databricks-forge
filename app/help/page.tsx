// FAQ
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "What data does Forge AI access?",
    answer:
      "Forge AI reads only metadata (table names, column names, data types, foreign keys) from your Unity Catalog information_schema. No row-level data is accessed unless you enable data sampling in Settings, which reads a small number of sample rows for column profiling. Sampled data is not persisted.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the pipeline fails?",
    answer:
      'If a pipeline fails mid-run, you can click "Resume Pipeline" on the run detail page to restart from the last successful step. All previously completed steps are preserved.',
  },
  {
    question: "What is an Estate Scan?",
    answer:
      "An estate scan runs 8 LLM intelligence passes over your metadata: domain classification, PII detection, redundancy analysis, relationship discovery, data tier assignment, data product identification, governance scoring, and table descriptions. Results appear on the Estate page. You can run scans standalone or as part of a discovery pipeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Genie Spaces?",
    answer:
      "Genie Spaces are Databricks workspaces where business users can ask natural language questions that get translated into SQL. Forge AI generates pre-configured Genie Spaces with semantic expressions, filters, benchmark queries, and metric views based on your metadata and use cases.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Industry Outcome Maps?",
    answer:
      "Outcome maps are curated reference frameworks for specific industries (e.g., Financial Services, Healthcare, Retail). They define KPIs, strategic use cases, personas, and domain priorities. When selected during configuration, they enrich the LLM prompts for more targeted, industry-aligned recommendations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does scoring work?",
    answer:
      "Each use case is scored on 4 dimensions: Feasibility (how implementable), Business Value (potential impact), Innovation (novelty), and Data Readiness (metadata quality). The composite score is a weighted average. Business priorities boost aligned use case scores. Scores are then calibrated and deduplicated.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Knowledge Base?",
    answer:
      "The Knowledge Base lets you upload documents (PDFs, Markdown, text files) that are chunked and embedded for semantic retrieval. These documents enrich Ask Forge answers and provide additional context for discovery prompts. Examples include strategy decks, data dictionaries, and governance policies.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Ask Forge work?",
    answer:
      "Ask Forge uses a dual-strategy RAG pipeline: direct Lakebase queries for structured context (business context, estate summary, deployed assets) plus pgvector semantic search across 12 embedding kinds. The LLM receives grounded context and generates responses citing specific sources. All SQL proposals use only real table and column names from your estate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I compare multiple runs?",
    answer:
      'Yes. Navigate to "Compare" in the sidebar, select two completed runs, and view side-by-side metrics, use case overlap, semantic similarity, configuration differences, prompt diffs, and step-level timing. You can export the comparison to Excel.',
  },
  {
    question: "Where are my settings saved?",
    answer:
      "Application settings (discovery depth, Genie defaults, export preferences) are stored in your browser's localStorage. They persist across sessions but are local to your browser. Pipeline runs, use cases, scans, conversations, and exports are stored in Lakebase (server-side).",
  },
  {
    question: "What embedding endpoint do I need?",
    answer:
      "Forge AI uses the databricks-gte-large-en model (1024-dimensional vectors) via a Model Serving endpoint. Configure the endpoint name in Settings under Semantic Search & RAG. When enabled, it powers Ask Forge's RAG, Knowledge Base, semantic search in the Estate tab, and run comparison overlap analysis.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data sent outside my workspace?",
    answer:
      "No. All LLM calls go through your workspace's Model Serving endpoints. All data stays within your Databricks environment. Authentication is handled automatically by the Databricks Apps platform.",
  },

  "Use the Catalog Browser to precisely scope your metadata. Scanning fewer schemas produces more focused, higher-quality results.",
  "Enable Estate Scan on your first run for a comprehensive view of data health, governance, and lineage across your estate.",
  "Upload strategy decks and data dictionaries to the Knowledge Base — Ask Forge uses them to give more contextual answers.",
  "Use ⌘J (Mac) or Ctrl+J to quickly toggle Ask Forge from anywhere in the app.",
  "The Compare page is great for A/B testing different configurations or validating prompt improvements across runs.",

            Forge AI reads only metadata (table and column names, data types,
            foreign keys) from your Unity Catalog. No row-level data is accessed
            unless data sampling is explicitly enabled in Settings — sampled data
            is sent to the LLM but never persisted.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            All LLM calls go through your workspace&apos;s Model Serving
            endpoints — no data leaves your Databricks environment.
            Authentication is handled automatically by the Databricks Apps
            platform. Conversation history and pipeline results are stored in
            Lakebase within your workspace.
