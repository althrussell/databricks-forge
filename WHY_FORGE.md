## Built for Databricks Customers

### Works with your platform, not around it

Forge AI is designed for teams already running on Databricks:

- Uses your **Unity Catalog** metadata as the source of truth.
- Runs SQL on your **SQL Warehouse**.
- Uses your **Model Serving** endpoints for AI generation.
- Deploys as a **Databricks App** in your workspace.

No new platform to adopt. No extra infrastructure to maintain.

### Enterprise-ready trust and governance

- **Metadata-first by default:** Schema and table metadata only, unless you explicitly enable sampling.
- **Workspace-native processing:** Data remains in your Databricks environment.
- **Transparent outputs:** AI-generated recommendations are traceable and reviewable.
